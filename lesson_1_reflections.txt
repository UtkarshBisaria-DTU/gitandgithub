git is a version control system offline or online and can be used in conjuction with github. 

commit is a component of git.

commit creates a checkpoint of the code. These checkpoints generally represent a different version of the software and have a meaningful append and change in them.

A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per logical change. 

git errors and warnings -
You are in 'detached HEAD' state
HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.
